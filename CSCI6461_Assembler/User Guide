# DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

## Introduction
This document contains the detailed design and architecture for the CSCI6461 Assembler project.

## Overview
The assembler is designed to translate assembly language code into machine code. It exhibits modular design principles, making it easy to update and maintain.

## Module Descriptions
### Lexer
- Responsible for tokenizing the input assembly code.
- It reads characters and identifies different tokens such as labels, instructions, and operands.

### Parser
- Processes the tokens generated by the lexer.
- Checks for syntax errors and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

### Code Generator
- Translates the AST into machine code.
- Optimizes the generated machine code for efficiency.

## Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: Used for managing instances of the assembler to avoid redundant resource usage.
- **Factory Method**: Employed for creating different types of instructions based on the input.

## Conclusion
This document will be updated as the project evolves. For any changes in design or architecture, please refer to the version history.
